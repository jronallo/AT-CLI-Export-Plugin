This plugin is for automating data exports from Archivists' Toolkit.

The cli framework and much of the design and credit belong to Nathan Stevens of AT fame, I just hacked together a rather nasty initial solution to a problem I had but he is responsible for expanding the plugin interface to support the command line.

This plugin is very green and should you wish to add/modify any features please feel free to fork this and go to town.

Usage

atcli.command DATABASEPASSWORD ead ~/path/for/exported/files/

First param is the database password
Second param is the export type, currently only ead is supported
Third param is the location where the generated exports will reside, be sure to include a trailing /

This will export all resources with a find aid status of complete.  Each resource will be exported to a file named RESOURCE_ID.xml.

If you have stack issues, you can modify the atcli.command file under your AT installation by adding something similiar to options="$options -Xms32m -Xmx512m" where the options are set.  This is dependent on your local jvm and the potential size of your resources.
